      <description>Models can be built incrementally by modifying their hyperparameters during training. This is most common in transfer learning settings, in which we seek to adapt the knowledge in an existing model for a new domain or task. The more general problem of continuous learning is also an obvious application. Even with a predefined data set, however, incrementally constraining the topology of the network can offer benefits as regularization.
Dynamic Hyperparameters The easiest incrementally modified models to train may be those in which hyperparameters are updated at each epoch.</description>

      <description>[Note - This is a repost of a post I made on my old blog while I was in undergrad. I&amp;rsquo;m including it in case someone finds it useful, since my old blog is defunct. I haven&amp;rsquo;t significantly edited it, so I&amp;rsquo;m sorry if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit into my current style.]
This post is directed to a lay CS audience. I am an undergraduate in CS, so I consider myself part of that audience.</description>
